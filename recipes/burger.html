<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A smash burger is a burger thatâ€™s made by smashing two thin beef patties together with cheese in the middle. The act of pressing the burgers together over heat creates a perfect sear on the outside, ensuring juicy and flavorful results every time.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
  <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
  <li>4 (6-inch) squares parchment paper</li>
  <li> salt to taste</li>
  <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
  <li> burger toppings of choice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking. </li>
  <li>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside. </li>
  <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt. </li>
